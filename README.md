download [clean.bat](https://github.com/Mylloon/clean-temporary-files/blob/master/clean.bat) (recommended) and run it.

require admin rights

it will delete everything in *C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Local\Temp*; *C:\Windows\Temp*; *C:\Windows\Preetch* (files and folders, subs included)

--

the lite version [clean-lite.bat](https://github.com/Mylloon/clean-temporary-files/blob/master/clean-lite.bat) the lite version doesn't require administrator privileges, but only removes what's in *C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Local\Temp*

--

The tool will also run cleanmgr.exe and clean your disk

--

I do not recommend this tool if you are not using an SSD. If you don't use one, simply run a cleanmgr.exe
